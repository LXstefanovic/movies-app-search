# movies-app-search

This repository contains movie search application demo that allows users to search by movie title. 
It uses OMDB API(omdbapi.com). Omdb API currently only support search by title and year, 
so search by Person is not available. 

This application was created with React technology stack.
It provides an example how to structure scalable React application.

### `npm start`

You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`
